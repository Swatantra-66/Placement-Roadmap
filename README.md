# 📘 Placement Roadmap Dashboard

An interactive **placement preparation tracker** designed for students preparing for campus placements and coding interviews.  
This roadmap breaks down preparation into **phases** (Foundation, Core DSA, Advanced, and Interview Prep), with progress tracking for each topic (Arrays, Strings, Sorting, etc.).
